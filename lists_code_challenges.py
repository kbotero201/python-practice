# Easy List Code Challenges 

# Every Three Numbers 
# Create a function called every_three_nums that has one parameter named start.
# The function should return a list of every third number between start and 100 (inclusive). For example, every_three_nums(91) should return the list [91, 94, 97, 100]. If start is greater than 100, the function should return an empty list.

def every_three_nums(start):
  if start > 100:
    return []
  else:
    return (list(range(start, 101, 3)))

# Remove Middle 
# Create a function named remove_middle which has three parameters named lst, start, and end.
# The function should return a list where all elements in lst with an index between start and end (inclusive) have been removed.
# For example, the following code should return [4, 23, 42] because elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 have been removed:
# remove_middle([4, 8 , 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3)
